    <h1>Problem</h1>
     <h2>Situation</h2>
      <p>Situation: Students are required to design a electronics project that solves a real world issue of their choice. The project should demonstrate a range of practical skills covered throughout the unit by making use of the arduino and spark fun red boards anlong with electronic circuits. </p>
     <h2>Brief</h2>
      <p>Brief: Hundreds of people get lost hiking each year. Design a compact tracking modual that can last up to two weeks of charge once activated and will send out a signal to google maps so you can find your way back. </p>
     <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <h3>-Cost</h3>
      <p>The Cost of the Product should be under $50 (for the sake of self preservation). </p>
      <h3>-Resources</h3>
      <p>I am limited to only what the school has and what I'm willing to buy. Therefor the design should make use of the Ardunino UNO that the school provides. </p>
      <h3>-Time</h3>
      <p>The GPS has to be finished at by latest 6th of May 2016. This means that everything that it can do needs to be built by then. </p>
      <h3>-Skills</h3>
      <p>I am limited to only what I am capable of on my own without assistance. This means that I need to allready have the skills (or the ability to obtain them) that are required to build the project. </p>
      <h3>-Hardware</h3>
      <p>I only have the macbook ardunino program to design any programs on so then program must be possible with arduino commands. This means that anything that needs any other type of coding won't work. </p>
