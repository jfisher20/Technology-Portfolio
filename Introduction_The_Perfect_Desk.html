    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <h2>General Saftey Rules</h2>
      <h3>1. List 8 Saftey Rules that should be followed when in the Reed building.</h3>
      <p></p>
      <h3>2. The Importance of Risk assesment when working in a Practical envirenment.</h3>
      <p>Risk assesment is critical to identifying and ilimenating/minimalizing risks in the practical envirenment, to insure the saftey of yourself and the safty of those around you. Risk assesment stops acidents before they happen.</p>
      <h3>3. How the Saftey tests are undertaken and recorded.</h3>
      <p>The saftey tests and tutourials are normally undertaken and recorded online via links to websites such as google surveys and are recorded by the school for future use.</p>
      <h3>4. The Significance and importance of the completion of the saftey tests.</h3>
      <p>It is important to complete the saftey tests so that we understand the work envirenment and can protect ourselfs agaist the equitment and tools around us.</p>
    <h2>The Prime Design Cycle</h2>
      <h3>5. Design Definition</h3>
      <p>Design- A plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a building, garment, or other object before it is made.</p>
      <h3>6. Technology Definition</h3>
      <p>Technology- Technology is machinery and devices developed from scientific knowledge. (anything made by man is technology)</p>
      <h3>7. An Outline of the Prime Design Stages</h3>
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>Problem is the design brief. It tells us the issue that our design has to solve. The problem is the opposite to the design because the design is the solution and is normally very brief just depicting the function and athstetics of the Final Product.</p>
      <h3>Research</h3>
      <p>Reasearch is looking at what has been done previously to try to solve the issue and what could improve your design. Normally a idea or design is formed from numerous chunks of other designs because imagination is the abilty to combine existing technology.</p>
      <h3>Ideas</h3>
      <p>Ideas is the actual designing of our product and is done usually using pencil and paper sketchs. It is what we will build that we design in the ideas phase. </p>
      <h3>Make</h3>
      <p>Make is when you build the idea and bring it to life. It melts from a design into a tangable object that can preform whatever the design situation requires it to do.</p>
      <h3>Evaluate</h3>
      <p>Evaluate is the easiest stage in the PRIME process. It is simpily taking the final product and reviewing what made it good.</p>
